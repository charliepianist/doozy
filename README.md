## Doozy's Goal
Arguments today, both political and otherwise, get heated easily, and the spirit of democracy gets lost amidst the verbal fighting. Our application seeks to remedy this issue by first bringing people together with a shared hobby, then helping them resolve their differences or "agree to disagree" peacefully. Our platform matches people with a common interest and different views on important issues, and gives them a chatroom just for them to discuss and get to know one another.
